# End-to-End MLOps Platform

An industry-level **End-to-End Machine Learning Platform** that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of ML systems — from data ingestion and analysis to model deployment and monitoring.

This project is designed to showcase **Data Science + Machine Learning Engineering + MLOps** skills in a production-style architecture.

---

## Problem Statements

This platform supports multiple real-world ML problems:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - Predict whether a customer will leave a telecom service.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - Detect fraudulent financial transactions.
